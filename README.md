# Runescape-Installer
Appears as a Runescape Installer. Changes your wallpaper, deletes your master boot record, and encrypts files on your hard drive. The encryption key is generated using a randomly generated 16 character string, which is then put into a derivation function in order to generate an AES-256 key. Since the password is a new one every time, file decryption is as far as i know impossible.
